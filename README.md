* conducting exploratory data analysis on the dataset
* applying dimensionality reductiong algorithms PCA and visualising it through TSNE

Summary:
The data seems to be very noisy even when data balancing was performed. Accuracy can be increased by specifying precise medical speciality. For ex: the data of neurosurgery is a part of neurology, hence the data for neurosurgery and neurology is relatively less than that of general medicine.
