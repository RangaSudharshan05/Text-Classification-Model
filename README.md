# Text-Classification-Model

## Classification over medical transcripts
Objective:
* conducting exploratory data analysis on the dataset
* applying various dimensionality reductiong algorithms such truncated SVD, PCA and visualising it through TSNE 

Summary:
The data seems to be very noisy even when data balancing was performed. Accuracy can be increased by specifying precise medical speciality. For ex: the data of neurosurgery is a part of neurology, hence the data for neurosurgery and neurology is relatively less than that of general medicine.
